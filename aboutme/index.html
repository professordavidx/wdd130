	<h2>Everyone calls me Dave!</h2>
	<p>Hi everyone! My name is David. I have a wonderful family. We live in Colombia, south America. I love playing video games as well listening to progressive rock. 
	   When it comes to movies I truly love the sci-fi genre, specially the alien franchise and the matrix. 
	   Above all The book of Mormon is my top choice of reading and spiritual guidance.</p>

	</p>I enjoy having a double cheese burger with a side of fries and a milkshake, nothing can beat that.
	    Something unique about me is that I have a passion for technology. I love tinkering and  learning how things work.
	    I have learnt a great deal by myself when it comes to computers, software design and programming.
	    People come to me for help with their laptops and I do most of my work for free. I take it as a hobby, but now I am thinking it is the time to take my hobby to the next level. </p>
