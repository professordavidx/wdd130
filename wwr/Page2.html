				<h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
				<p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
					You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
				    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
				    The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids,but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
					CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
					However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

				<h2>Highlights from the past season </h2>
				<p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. 
				   We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family.
				   Season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip.
				   Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p>
